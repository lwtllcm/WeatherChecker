# WeatherChecker

WeatherChecker is a Capstone App for the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree.  This app lets you enter locations on a map and the map will show pins for those locations.  There is a "Weather Info" button to see the weather conditions for those locations.  If you select a location from the Weather Info table, the app shows a detail view with  additional weather info for that location.
